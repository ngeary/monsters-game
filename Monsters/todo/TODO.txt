Game Fixes/Enhancements
	Finish battle mechanics
		Add moves
			Database full of moves or generic moves?
	Let player re-order monster list
	Monsters gain experience/levels
	Score?
	Let players create MonsterTypes and BasicOpponents
	Respawning of opponents
		Stay in current state if you lost?
		Respawn if you won?
		Try to eliminate all opponents?
		Don't select opponent for battle if eliminated?
	
Programming Improvements
	Clean up code
		Make it as modular as possible
		Make sure all methods are in logical classes
		Minimize repetition
		Anything that is loaded/saved should mirror BattleMove class
	I think I should be implementing interfaces (raw-string-able? SQL-able?)
	Add comments
	Is HashMap the right Collection for classes where the primary key is an integer?

Programming Challenges
	Integrate with SQL databases
		Make choice between flat file / SQL tables
		Build support for SQL tables
		Build SQL tables
	Turn into a web app?
		Probably not-- just make available on Java Web Start
	Implement a GUI

	
	
	
Need generic load/store methods in each "object" class (monster type, opponent, maybe game)

	public static MyClass loadMyClassFromDatabase(PrimaryKey pk) {
		return myClass;
	}
	
	public static void storeMyClassInDatabase(MyClass mc) {
	}

	public static MonsterType getMonsterTypeFromDatabase(int monsterTypeID) {
		DatabaseSettings dbs = Monsters.getDatabaseSettings();
		
		if (dbs.getFormat().equals("flat file")) {
			return getMonsterTypeFromFlatFile(dbs.getMonsterTypeFilename(), monsterTypeID);
		} else if (dbs.getFormat().equals("SQL table")) {
			return getMonsterTypeFromSQLTable(dbs.getMonsterTypeTableName(), monsterTypeID);
		}
	}
	
The format of the database needs to be completely abstracted from Monsters, Encounter, Battle, etc.
Format of the database should be stored in a new class (say, DatabaseSettings) similar to GameSettings.
Move file names from GameSettings to DatabaseSettings.

Level-3 looks like negative 3
Player wants to see her name as a trainer
Monsters need to gain experience and level up
